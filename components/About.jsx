        <p>
          I am an aspiring Software Engineer currently pursuing my B.Tech in
          Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (2025–2029) at MEA Engineering
          College, Malappuram.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy building functional, aesthetic, and user-centric applications.
          My interests span web development, AI, and digital product design —
          with a long-term goal of making finance and fitness more accessible
          through technology.
        </p>

        <p className="philosophy">
          My philosophy is <strong>Calm Excellence</strong> — solving complex
          problems with simple, elegant solutions.
